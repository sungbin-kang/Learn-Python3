# The Fender, a notorious computer hacker and general villain of the people,
# has compromised several top-secret passwords including your own. Your
# mission, should you choose to accept it, is threefold. You must acquire
# access to The Fenderâ€˜s systems, you must update his "passwords.txt" file
# to scramble the secret data. The last thing you need to do is add the
# signature of Slash Null, a different hacker whose nefarious deeds could be
# very conveniently halted by The Fender if they viewed Slash Null as a threat.
